      <h2>About Page</h2>
      <p>Advanced Test Management and Certification Labs (ATMCL) is a Seattle-based
          wireless device testing laboratory offering test products and services to the
          wireless industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        ATMCL was founded on the principle of distributed testing. Traditional “test
        houses” have long operated by making huge capital investments in test
        equipment and facilities to build their laboratories at a fixed location. This is no
        longer a cost-effective approach. The high equipment costs, rapid evolution of
        test equipment and test requirements and the ongoing maintenance and staffing
        costs of such facilities makes this no longer feasible. Such test houses find
        themselves continually compromising quality, coverage and cost-effectiveness to
        their customers so as to remain viable.
      </p>
      <p>
        ATMCL believes that the physical location where testing is executed is largely
        unimportant. A full range of test services are available to clients using a
        combination of facilities including our state-of-the-art accredited test laboratory in
        Seattle along with facilities of our various partner facilities including Apkudo and
        CTTL. With this network of providers along with US-based project management
        and advanced test management tools and systems, ATMCL can offer a virtual
        “one-stop shop” for all wireless device testing and certification needs with a
        higher efficiency, quality and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional test
        houses.
      </p>
      <p>
        With advanced communication tools, remote services and streamlined logistics,
        ATMCL has unrivaled test coverage for wireless devices and offers those
        services with the highest quality and cost effectiveness
